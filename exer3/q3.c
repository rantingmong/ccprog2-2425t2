/**
 * Create a struct named "Courses" with these fields:
 * - id: a string exactly 8 characters in which the course code will be placed
 * - units: an integer
 * - passed: a boolean representing if the student has passed or failed the subject
 *
 * Create a function that would record a student's course information.
 * Said function will ask for those fields above.
 *
 * This struct will be added as an array item to the "Student" struct that was created earlier.
 * Finally, add all the courses in printing the struct information.
 *
 * Also create a function given the course code, the student struct, and a boolean value, to indicate
 * if a student has passed/failed a course.
