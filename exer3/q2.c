/**
 * Create a struct named "Term" with these fields:
 * - year: an integer that represents the year
 * - termNumber: an integer that represents which term it is (eg 1, 2, 3)
 * - hasPaid: a boolean (import stdbool.h) if the student has paid their tuition fee
 * - irregular: a boolean if the student has failed a class the previous term
 *
 * Create a function that would record a student's current term information.
 * Said function will ask for those fields above.
 *
 * Also add this struct as a field to the "Student" struct that was created earlier.
 * Add the current term information on printing the student fields.
 *
 * Finally, create a function that would set if the student has paid or not paid their tuition fee.
 *
 * Restriction: the Student struct must be created before asking the user for current term information.
